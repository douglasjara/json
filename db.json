      "answer": "myth",
      "explanation": "SARS-CoV-2 causes an illness that does have flu-like symptoms, such as aches, a fever, and a cough. Similarly, both COVID-19 and the flu can be mild, severe, or, in rare cases, fatal. Both can also lead to pneumonia. However, the overall profile of COVID-19 is more serious. Estimates vary, but its mortality rate seems to be between about 1% and 3%. Although scientists are still working out the exact mortality rate, it is likely to be many times higher than that of seasonal flu."

      "question": "Consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol (ethanol), particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol, can result in severe health consequences, including death.",
      "answer": "truth",
      "explanation": "n response to a series of myths surrounding alcohol and COVID-19, the WHO released a statement. In it, they explain that although alcohol can disinfect the skin, it does not work the same way inside the body. They explain that “consuming any alcohol poses health risks, but consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol (ethanol), particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol, can result in severe health consequences, including death.”. In a fact sheet on the subject, they write that, “Alcohol use, especially heavy use, weakens the immune system and thus reduces the ability to cope with infectious diseases.”. Because alcohol is associated with a number of diseases, it may make people more vulnerable to COVID-19."
